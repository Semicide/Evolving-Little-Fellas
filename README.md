# Evolving Little Fellas
An Evolution Simulation made on Python with Genetic Algorithm

The primary objective of the project is to simulate an evolutionary process using genetic algorithms. 
This evolutionary process will allow us to observe how a specific population changes over time and how its adaptive abilities evolve in response to environmental challenges.
