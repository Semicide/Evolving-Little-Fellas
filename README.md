# Evolving Little Fellas
 These little fellas do be evolving tho!!!

The primary objective of the project is to simulate an evolutionary process using genetic algorithms. 
This evolutionary process will allow us to observe how a specific population changes over time and how its adaptive abilities evolve in response to environmental challenges.
